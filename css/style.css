 /* Step One: Animating Logo */

/* Step Three: Edit the css for the header tag (all instances) to use flex to match our example. */

header {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
}

/* Step Four: Edit the css for the nav_links class to use flex to match our example. Do not modify the list items or the links - modify the nav_links class to use flex. */

.nav_links {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;

/* Step Five: Style the links so that they have the same color even after they have been visited. This is a “challenge” problem. You should not give or receive help when completing it. */

    border-top-left-radius: 50px;
}

/* Step Seven: Edit the css for the card class to match our example. Achieve this by using a flex-property to specify an initial “size” of 450px.  You need to think about this from a “flex” perspective and realize that flex-direction will affect the size of the elements.  You can see that in the mobile view they all have the same width. */

.card {
    display: flex;
    width: 450px;
    flex-direction: column;
}

/* Step Eight: Edit the css for the pricing class to match our example. You should use flex and the cards should be centered both horizontally and vertically. */

    display: flex;

    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;

/* Step Nine: Style the images in the gallery class. These elements will have a solid 10px border with a color of #50C7C7, 10px margin on all four sides and a width of 300px. */

.gallery img{
    border: solid 10px #50C7C7;
    margin: 10px;
    width: 300px;
}

/* Step Ten: Edit the css for the gallery class to use flex to match our example. (You may want to look at the screen shots from 1200px and 1500px as well -  the changes are not from media queries, but from the use of flex.) */

.gallery {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 900px) {

    /* Step Eleven: Edit the css for the header tag (all instances) and the nav_links class to match our example using flex-properties. The logo should be as far to the left as possible and the links as far to the right as possible. Use flex properties, NOT position properties. */

    /* Step Twelve: Edit the css for the pricing and card classes to match our example. Part of achieving this is by using a flex-property to specify a “size” of 275px. Notice that the elements do not have the same height, but do have the same width. */

    .card {
        display: flex;
        width: 275px;

        flex-direction: row;
    }

    /* Step Thirteen: Modify the first header (the one not inside main) so that it remains visible at the top of the screen even as we scroll down. Make sure that it is always visible. You can see an example of this in the video and in the screenshot at 1200px when scrolled. This is a challenge problem. You should not give or receive help when completing it. */

    body > header:first-of-type {
        position: sticky;
        top: 0;
    }

    /* Step Fourteen: The logo class should appear but not be animated if prefers-reduced-motion is selected in the accessibility preferences. */

          animation: none;
        }

     /* Step Sixteen: Remove background image */

        background-image: none;
    }

    /* Step Seventeen: Edit the nav/nav_links elements so that they are spaced according to the image above. */

    .nav_links {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: row;
    }

    /* Step Eighteen: Edit the pricing class so that the elements align along the bottom.  As long as it aligns along the bottom we don't care if the cards aren't the same height. */

    .pricing {
        flex-direction: row;
        align-items: flex-end;
    }

    /* Step Nineteen: The card elements should have a solid border 2px of #45ADDD and use flex-basis of 325px. */

    .card {
        border: solid 2px #45ADDD;
    }

    /* Step Twenty: No part of the gallery should be visible */

    #gallery, .gallery{
